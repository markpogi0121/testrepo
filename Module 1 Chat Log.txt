01:16:34	gauri sethi:	Hi everyone
01:16:38	Kirk Dugdell:	hi all
01:17:55	Rob B:	That link works for me
01:18:09	Hibin Maheendran:	How long do we have to learn the complete topics and take the exam ?
01:18:23	Kusala Dehiwala Liyanage:	4 weeks
01:18:39	Kikomeko patrick kato:	Share the link hea please
01:19:00	Hibin Maheendran:	4 weeks is the course right, so do we have any time frame, to finish the exam ?
01:19:07	Mat Sanchez:	how long does the cisco certificate last for ?
01:19:08	Lily Nguyen:	After the final webinar, the exam will always be open, so take it whenever you feel ready after completing all of the material! You'll have 1 attempt and 1 hour.
01:19:15	Rob B:	The exam doesn't expire.  You can do it any time
01:19:36	Lily Nguyen:	All webinar materials (slides, video, etc.) will be made available within 24 hours at http://learn.itmasters.edu.au
01:20:11	Akash Prabhakaran:	Hi, is the final exam different from the CISCO certificate or is it the same exam
01:20:23	Levi:	For financial institutions in Australia, the responsibility relies on the board and they are held accountable now :)
01:22:01	Lily Nguyen:	Hi Akash, you won't receive any industry qualifications after this short course - if you pass the final exam you'll receive a Certificate of Completion.
01:22:33	Sharmin Provhat:	But how can I get the materials, like do I need to have any user Id and password?
01:22:46	Shane Murphy:	Hi Akash, Matt just explained that it covers only a part of the full CyberOPs certificate so no it is not the same.
01:22:59	Lily Nguyen:	Hi Sharmin, have you registered here? https://itmasters.edu.au/short-courses/introduction-to-cyberops/
01:23:14	Dash Amr:	Can we redo the course final exam ?
01:23:27	Kusala Dehiwala Liyanage:	Sadly Not
01:23:49	Jason Brown:	Speaking as a manager, Certificates of Completion are still valuable! (Lily/Akash)
01:24:10	Lily Nguyen:	You'll only get 1 hour and 1 attempt at the final exam.
01:24:20	Steve Punitham:	kine between intranet and internet is blurring
01:24:45	Hibin Maheendran:	What if we don't pass in that 1 attempt?
01:24:56	Lily Nguyen:	Great to hear Jason!! Getting 3 certificates will also grant you 1 subject credit for one of our postgraduate courses as well ☺️
01:25:24	K Pham:	After this class will all these materials (slide, video, etc) be email with the link??? SO how I am unable to open the link
01:25:50	K Pham:	somehow*
01:26:12	Oyekunbi Adetoro:	Is attendance at the webinars mandatory.  Is it okay to listen to the recordings afterwards?
01:26:40	Lily Nguyen:	Unfortunately you'll only receive the Certificate of Completion if you pass the exam.
01:26:46	John Frederick Sano:	Good day to everyone! from Philippines :)
01:26:57	Jeziree Gaspar:	Good day
01:27:00	vinal ram:	Where can I get the link for this on the web
01:27:09	harry wwc:	@oyekunibi - is ok to listen to recordings
01:27:09	Lily Nguyen:	Hi K, which link are you attempting to open?
01:27:20	Osman Sevgikuranlar:	Hi everyone!
01:27:23	Techy Cyber:	https://itmasters.edu.au/short-courses/introduction-to-cyberops/
01:27:35	Patricia Mc Gurren:	is it possible to turn up the volume?
01:27:37	Robert Maneswa:	Good day to you all from Zimbabwe..
01:27:40	Lily Nguyen:	Webinar attendance is not mandatory, feel free to catch the recording if you can't make it!
01:27:43	Sharmin Provhat:	https://learn.itmasters.edu.au/login/index.php
01:27:50	Ashish:	is 27001 still relevant?
01:28:04	Toton Liantoro:	Hi Everyone, nice to meet you all...🙂
01:28:14	Muhammad Sajid Iqbal:	Good Aftrennon to everyone from Pakistan.
01:28:28	Lily Nguyen:	We'll have the webinar materials (slides, video, etc.) available within 24 hours at http://learn.itmasters.edu.au
01:28:28	K Pham:	http://learn.itmasters.edu.au/ (but im guess it be available within 24hrs) after this class?
01:28:36	K Green:	Hmmm.  Originally Sec+ didn't specify internal/external.  Any idea when it began to diverge for this understanding of CyberSec vs/continuing InfoSec?
01:28:57	AM Yulatic PAF:	how to get the certificates?
01:29:07	Lily Nguyen:	The slides are already up on the short course portal for you to download.
01:29:30	Angela Dimos:	Hello Lily. I never received my user name and password to log in and access the material for this course.
01:29:47	Lily Nguyen:	You will need to receive a mark of 50% or more in the final exam to pass the course and receive a Certificate of Completion. If you pass your exam, the Certificate will be available for download in the Assessment section of your learning portal.
01:30:02	K Pham:	ah ok, ill see I can download the slide, Thankyou
01:30:11	cory McInnes:	surprised that DDOS attacks isn't on there
01:30:25	Amay Mankad:	Is it possible to do this course and be eligible for credits to do Certificate IV Cybersecurity?
01:30:31	Lily Nguyen:	Hi Angela, can you email your enquiry to admin@itmasters.edu.au so we can look into it?
01:30:44	Angela Dimos:	👍🏻 Thanks Lily
01:30:46	John Mire:	Whats the diff between 5 & 11
01:30:52	Lily Nguyen:	🤗
01:31:05	Benjamin Stokes Stokes:	6
01:31:09	Lily Nguyen:	Remember everyone, if you have a question for the mentor, post it in the Q&A section.
01:31:15	Paul Vorrasi:	go to Shodan.io to see how good IOT security is... its a great way of seeing peoples cams that they haven't secured
01:31:24	Levi:	Im surprised brute force attacks isnt on there
01:31:26	Emmanuel Otika:	I think 6 is also closely linked to 14
01:31:41	Rohit Jain:	Is the exam online too and can be taken anytime.?
01:31:45	K Green:	If I've filled out the interest in post-bachelor classes, what/when should I expect information?  I filled out the interest/you may get credit for professional certifications (CCNA, etc)
01:31:48	Levi:	in Australia, its a huge problem, especially with FI's and internet banking
01:31:55	cory McInnes:	^^
01:31:59	Saron Mariathasan:	Snowden!
01:32:13	Rob B:	Nation states are APTs, but not all APT are nation states
01:32:31	Stuart McDonald:	Deep fakes are an example of #11
01:32:43	George Kiio:	Hey everyone
01:32:55	K Green:	Hey George
01:33:01	Emmanuel Otika:	@ROb B: Thanks for the clarification
01:33:12	Azfar Ahmad:	This link did not work: https://shodan.io/
01:33:42	Cynthia Imari:	Hello.
01:33:50	Levi:	the Optus hack happened because there is no info sec governance in that industry lol
01:34:38	cory McInnes:	human error
01:34:53	Paul Vorrasi:	@azfar you may need to use a VPN to get to it, your ISP may have blocked it
01:35:17	Blu Corbel:	Eternal blue
01:35:39	Dash Amr:	Just a heads up. Incident response consortium playbook link is 404 error
01:35:58	K Green:	also zero day, zero days of warning
01:36:22	Levi:	and also 0sec :)
01:36:27	Laura Lees:	yes it was human error... not a lack of governance... they do have governance... there was someone that circumvented process
01:36:31	Andrew Stewart:	the bad guys found it before the good guys
01:36:36	Robin van Bergen:	https://cve.mitre.org has been replaced by https://cve.org
01:36:53	Lily Nguyen:	Hi, did you fill out the IT Masters eligibility form?
01:38:16	K Green:	Yes, looking up date now
01:38:44	Levi:	Laura Lees compare the telecommunications industry to the financial industry regulated by APRA.. we are HEAVILY regulated, the telecommunications industry have accc/acma who don't focus on security
01:39:21	Levi:	an info sec audit would have picked the API open to the world
01:39:48	Levi:	even basic pen testing :)
01:40:14	K Green:	11/27/23
01:40:20	Jay Sharma:	isnt an employee also an asset ?
01:40:26	Mat Sanchez:	are we going to learn about pen testing ?
01:40:48	David Reuben:	Assets include value of that asset, more valuable / important, more effort to protect.
01:41:39	Minh Trinh:	Hi Mat, there is a short course for pen testing
01:41:47	K Green:	big problem is that coders are still taught to code, many haven't yet started to include "privacy by design" or DevSecOps
01:41:53	Robin van Bergen:	so bad IT practices at Optus, not checking their products through pen testing/info sec audit regularly. A telco holds a massive amount of  information, most of it considered as PII, so protecting that should be a key priority
01:42:05	Mat Sanchez:	Thank you I will look it up after this one thank you
01:42:42	Blu Corbel:	ITMasters have a pentesting course I sat it and passed it's pretty good the have their own exam image you have to beat.
It's 😎
01:42:43	Salahdine AFFOUN:	Can we use Eisenhower's quadrant (important and urgent) to choose what we want to protect?
01:42:45	T B:	The rainbow of hacker hat colours!
01:42:59	Levi:	Robin, yes exactly. You know who is worse than Optus.. the real estate industry - they contain SO much PII data and RARELY implement any security on their systems
01:43:37	Jason Brown:	Robin, Optus had statutory audits and pen tests on a regular basis. Having worked in telecoms, banking and other legally-secured organisations, it’s not just “doing the thing”, it’s “how you do the thing”. Nuance.
01:44:13	Robin van Bergen:	probably right Levi. Agree Jason, there is nuance
01:44:19	HS yap:	just quick pill if your govt related organizations liable for any data breach? we have had breaches and it seems those govt related organizations are not liable
01:44:25	HS yap:	*poll
01:44:41	Lily Nguyen:	Thanks, which email did you include in the form to be contacted on?
01:46:00	Jonathan Deluao:	Is it possible to get a copy of the presentation material? Thanks heaps and much appreciate if it is possible
01:46:33	Mat Sanchez:	can all these hacking attempt happen without any logs created ?
01:46:56	Stuart McDonald:	Mat, yes
01:46:58	Levi:	yes, if systems are configured to log correctly
01:47:01	Lily Nguyen:	Hi Jonathan, you can download the slides here: http://learn.itmasters.edu.au
01:47:02	Esteban Porras:	If a fail the exam, how can I get do the exam again ?
01:47:02	Levi:	arent*
01:47:10	Jason Brown:	“Can all these hacking attempt happen without any logs created” - sure, if you’re not collecting or retaining logs
01:47:24	Rohit Jain:	@HS yap, I don’t think so the government related org will be liable.
01:47:28	Joshua Clarke:	Is Threat Intelligence used by Red/Blue/Both teams ?
01:47:30	Lily Nguyen:	Unfortunately everyone only gets 1 attempt at the exam.
01:47:31	Levi:	a SIEM is a must for any business
01:47:57	Vann Ten:	Don't forget if they were successful with the hacking attempts they can also clear those logs so they hide their tracks of any evidence of it happening in the first place..
01:47:58	Ash Bennett:	Is this short course visible in the moodle app?
01:48:08	Job Simukonda:	how do we get the slides
01:48:37	Levi:	Vann Ten, not if your SIEM collects logs real time and is in its own DMZ
01:48:38	Lily Nguyen:	Hi Job, you can download the slides here: http://learn.itmasters.edu.au
01:48:39	Kusala Dehiwala Liyanage:	On the it masters page
01:48:39	Robin van Bergen:	@Mat Sanchez, it's a fine balance between logging enough / not enough. Too much is noise, to little is likely compromise. As Levi mentioned, that's where a SIEM is a must. Clearing logs should be picked up by your EDR/XDR and alert on it
01:48:55	K Green:	Actors not in it for a smash and grab usually try to remove log records of their activities, so it's not just are you keeping logs.  This is why you want >NTP for consistent logs and >Syslog or some other central/archivable place for logs.
01:49:09	Mat Sanchez:	Thank you
01:49:14	Vann Ten:	@Levi - Yes SIEM is a must these days..
01:49:16	Yakubu Ayhok:	hello everyone, greetings from Yakubu here in Nigeria.
01:49:36	Levi:	im actually writing some Splunk queries right now :)
01:49:40	K Green:	Hello Yakubu
01:49:41	Stuart McDonald:	@Robin, you hit the nail on the head. Most cyber incidents have a common theme of no logs or reduced logs
01:49:48	Elias Mane:	my login details isn't working on the protal
01:50:07	Elias Mane:	*Portal
01:50:28	Shane Murphy:	Hi Elias you can reset your password form the log in page
01:50:42	Libin Antony:	I haven't received the credentials yet. @Lily Nguyen will you please help me to get it
01:50:49	Levi:	it's a great idea for businesses to conduct a Cyber Incident Response Exercise - to ensure if you need to retrieve logs you have them, and the right information in those logs to determine how, what and when
01:51:02	Laura Lees:	Levi, On the regulation front though since APRA telcos have improve since they q2 suppliers to financial services/APRA regulated (under their third party assessments) and with SOCI telcos have also needed to improve though agree they still have a ways to go to get up to standard
01:51:04	Joshua Clarke:	Correct me if I'm wrong but cisco stuff is generally at the Network Layer of the OSI model, we're discussing Application Layer and other stuff.
01:51:08	Lily Nguyen:	Hi Libin, can you email your enquiry to admin@itmasters.edu.au so we can look into it?
01:51:30	Laura Lees:	esp. compared to some of the mature global banks
01:51:33	Kusala Dehiwala Liyanage:	What does cisco stand for
01:51:33	Jason Brown:	“Most cyber incidents have a common theme of no logs or reduced logs” -> honestly even if you think you’re keeping excessive logs, they may still be insufficient. Thing is, logging is not free.
01:51:44	David Reuben:	@Stuart, or not bother to check the logs...
01:51:46	Levi:	Laura, Yes I have heard that - hopefully they can mature really fast :)
01:51:51	jeffrey Phuah:	Don't a NOC do something similar?
01:52:32	Laura Lees:	regular pen testing is the way to go.. not just a once a year program
01:52:34	Stuart McDonald:	@Jason, yes you are right. Cost $$
01:52:40	Delight Aniche:	My login credential on the portal is not working
01:52:56	Levi:	Pen testing for all external ips should be performed monthly..
01:53:28	K Green:	@David, that's the problem with functional troubleshooting as well, other than a solid state drive failure there are always indicators in the logs if you turn them on and read them
01:53:47	Mat Sanchez:	interesting this PEN testing a must it seems. Is that a Linux based ?
01:54:02	Jason Brown:	“Pen testing for all external lips should be performed monthly” -> You’re probably getting pen tested for free on a constant basis, if you’re on the internet. But HEY, I WISH I HAD YOUR (imaginary) BUDGET
01:54:23	Laura Lees:	(pen testing) at least assessed for every change that is being implemented
01:54:38	Levi:	when you make the board/directors understand the importance of pen testing - they will throw money at it
01:54:54	Jason Brown:	Good luck with that Levi
01:54:57	Rob B:	@Levi on who's budget!  Pentesting is expensive haha :)
01:55:08	Rylan Painter:	You might mean vulnerability scans on all external infra monthly, not pen testing.
01:55:20	Robin van Bergen:	In my experience: security induction when starting, followed by continuous awareness programs, phishing tests, red teaming , knowledge awareness training, which could lead to face training if low (<80%) score
01:56:03	Laura Lees:	to be realistic though you are best to spread budget across different layers including prevention like secure configuration baselines and secure coding practices
01:56:17	Levi:	haha, I work for a Bank, we vulnerability scan weekly (workstations,laptops,firewalls,switches) and pen test our internet banking/external ip addresses monthly - its actually not that expensive
01:56:28	Laura Lees:	agree with you Robin
01:56:58	Rylan Painter:	Internal pen testing team, Levi?
01:57:02	Laura Lees:	vulnerability scan is different to pen testing though
01:57:05	K Green:	@Steve careful, CCNA was the Cisco cert, then it diverged to themed CCNA like Routing and Switching, or Network Security (you needed to know routing/switching to learn the NetSec).  Then they streamlined to CCNA ** except for CyberOps is its own thing **
01:57:08	Rod Hendricks:	What did SMA stand for?
01:57:17	Massih Ayubi:	In the right side of the network i miss some roll based segmentation of the network.
01:57:19	Laura Lees:	which bank @Levi?
01:57:22	Rob B:	ah..a banks budget  :0 say no more fam :D
01:57:31	Jason Brown:	@Levi an internal vulnerability scan is NOT a pen test.
01:57:43	K Green:	CCNA = basically still for routing & switching with some dev and some sec now rolled in
01:57:54	Levi:	no, we have an external partner who does our pen testing, internal pen testing is once a year
01:57:56	T B:	Vulnerability scanning forms part of a pen test.. =/= pen test.. no? ;'O
01:57:59	Jason Brown:	@Levi I’m gonna go ahead and guess you’ve never signed off on a purchase order for an ACTUAL pen test
01:58:00	Laura Lees:	even Banks budgets are limited...
01:58:03	Robin van Bergen:	@Rob: There are small and big banks with varying budgets / team sizes ;-)
01:58:20	Steve Punitham:	Cisco founded in San Fran Cisco
01:58:26	Benjamin Fitzpatrick:	San FranCisCo
01:59:08	Levi:	Like I said, when the board/directors understand how important cyber/info sec is when you work in a Bank, they dont care how much money they throw
01:59:13	Joshua Clarke:	Orgies ?  Oh, Ogres
01:59:20	Levi:	Banks make a huge profit here in Australia
01:59:34	Robin van Bergen:	Cisco came from San Francisco, where they originated. Their logo is the Golden Gate Bridge which is located there
01:59:35	T B:	As long as you can convince them it's important
01:59:43	Levi:	Jason, we just renewed our contract with our pen tester
01:59:46	Rob B:	I'm guessing a bank that does pen test monthly on external IPs is not a small bank.  The perimeters they have are insane.
01:59:47	harry wwc:	https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/swiss-cheese-model-cybersecurity-hicham-faik
02:01:58	Blu Corbel:	Since we are giving out links if you need anything to reference against for attacks my page is full of useful PDFs.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/blu-corbel-bb5700265?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app
02:02:23	Jason Brown:	I’m also guessing that a bank constantly doing a pen test is going to have to have serious amounts of internal resources to differentiate an external pen testing firm’s traffic from an actual attacker’s traffic.
02:02:39	Levi:	Jason: 2k a month for our monthly pen test, 50k a year for our weekly SIEM reporting
02:02:40	Jason Brown:	I’ve worked in a payments processor in the past and pen test month is a proper pain in the ass
02:03:07	Jason Brown:	$2k a month ok. This isn’t a big bank everyone
02:03:31	K Green:	and FAIR by OpenFAIR Group is working on making it quantifiable so boards and finance controllers can have numbers
02:03:33	Levi:	yeah we're no CBA, 4b in assets
02:04:34	Colleen Crisp:	NIST has updated the framework version 2.0 to include Govern
02:04:36	Robin van Bergen:	@Levi: member owned bank / mutual, judging by the size?
02:04:38	jeffrey Phuah:	risk matrix?
02:04:44	Levi:	Robin yep :)
02:04:48	K Green:	can people put their links into the forum please?  things in this chat are not copy/paste so we need to retype the whole URL into notes
02:04:50	Robin van Bergen:	:-)
02:05:15	Laura Lees:	@K Green, are you involved whey FAIR?
02:05:36	Tim S:	@ Jeffrey Phuah, I was just about to say the same thing. Risk Assessment Matrix 😎
02:06:09	Steve Punitham:	optus hack resulted in some obligations
02:06:23	Job Simukonda:	is the recording going to be available for us
02:06:28	Zoom user:	Do you think they are actually doing a risk analysis, I don’t think they are!
02:06:31	K Green:	Because "How much risk do we have?"  'some'  "And how much risk will we have if we spend money on you to fix this?"  'less'  is why we have problems getting buy-in until you or someone you know gets hacked
02:06:42	Genesis Amado:	am i late already?
02:06:53	Paul Vorrasi:	I'm the only Paul Vorrasi on the Planet :)
02:06:55	Lily Nguyen:	We'll upload the chat transcript for everyone who's interested in the links being posted!
02:06:59	T B:	my name is revoltingly unique I hate it
02:07:06	Levi:	K Green: it's all about residual risk :D
02:07:14	Laura Lees:	I have to head tough thanks for the conversation :) look forward to chatting via the forum/next week
02:07:44	Blu Corbel:	Just click on the links they are live so you can go to the page and it's in your history for later.
02:08:08	K Green:	the short version is that it's a fuzzy range, get it to the scope/range you are comfortable with and then a bunch of Monte Carlo simulations... would you bet your life guessing my height without knowing anything about me?  probably not.  would you bet your life my height is between 6 inches and 16 feet? yes.
02:08:17	K Green:	then you narrow that range
02:08:34	K Green:	you never get to an exact, just a manageable range
02:08:52	jeffrey Phuah:	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco
02:09:33	K Green:	Thank you Lily!!!! That would be great!!!!
02:09:43	Lily Nguyen:	Of course 🤗
02:09:59	Amitha K R:	Thanks
02:10:01	Tim S:	i cannot believe number porting is so easy and dangerous. What a massive vulnerability especially when  people use it for MFA
02:10:47	Robin van Bergen:	Number porting is getting harder and harder in Australia, they have learned something from previous breaches fortunately
02:11:10	Levi:	yeah, and we need to get rid of 2FA using SMS
02:11:10	Ash Bennett:	you'd be surprised how much information banks give their call centre staff, its scary
02:11:12	Anne Badger:	can lead to identity fraud to claim payments through Centrelink eg for disaster payments
02:11:12	K Green:	(and yes I have CCNA and CCNA Network Security and been through the Cisco training to teach CCNA - Cisco CyberOps is NOT part of Cisco CCNA - CCNA stands for Cisco certified network analyst)
02:11:37	Shane Murphy:	Portability is  a complex issue - can you imagine the kerfuffle if it was made harder? A lot of work went into setting it up because lack of portability was a major competitive dampener.
02:11:59	Lily Nguyen:	If you haven't received a follow-up email after filling out the eligibility form, you can reach out to our lovely Eligibility Officer Anna directly at eligibility@itmasters.edu.au 🙂
02:12:08	K Green:	@Shane do you mean data in motion, or shared data?
02:12:09	T B:	@Ash Bennett can confirm I used to work for a bank and the amount of information I had access to was actually wild
02:12:18	Steven Moore:	associate not analyst k green...
02:12:44	Levi:	@TB - we give call centre basic enquiry access - they can't really do much more
02:13:05	K Green:	versus P for professional yes, but my point is it's network not cyber
02:13:09	Mat Sanchez:	SOC = Data Centres ?
02:13:13	Levi:	i just wish our banking system provider had security in mind over just making profit
02:13:24	Robin van Bergen:	@Mat: Security Operations Centre
02:13:30	abeer albalushi:	security operation center
02:13:33	Jason Brown:	SOC =. Security Operations Centre Mat
02:13:45	T B:	@Levi - A lot of our access was enquiry only, however there was definitely more than necessary
02:13:46	Mat Sanchez:	Thank you
02:13:56	Levi:	now thats something that costs an arm and a leg.. a SOC
02:14:20	Jason Brown:	Meh, SOC can be a cubicle.
02:14:24	Jason Brown:	Again, nuance
02:14:28	Blu Corbel:	I can set up a remote cloud soc ran on active directory for about $500
02:14:34	John Oladipo:	@TB. I am sure the amount the data you have access to are critical information needed for you to efficiently perform your tasks.  Most banks employ data minimization in their policies.
02:14:47	Salahdine AFFOUN:	SOC people must have follow  a specific training courses?
02:14:53	Genesis Amado:	what is the next step after finishing this 4 weeks short course to land a job in the cyber sec community?
02:14:55	cory McInnes:	they are usually 24 hour too
02:14:58	Mat Sanchez:	so SOC can be located inside a Data Centre ?
02:15:25	Massih Ayubi:	SOC is a team not a device to be placed in DC
02:15:48	Jason Brown:	It CAN be in a data centre. In a small company it can be a virtual group. In a VERY small company it can be one or two people who are committed to 24hr coverage
02:15:51	jeffrey Phuah:	Anyone heard of esentire? https://www.esentire.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand-anz&utm_content=brand&sfcampaignid=701OI000005CM6kYAG&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAqsitBhDlARIsAGMR1RgiVjsKRGQE_VX_MIIqq_T2Nu2Y4b-RtLmASMsE_jWtuzdx-16DH0IaAn2UEALw_wcB
02:15:59	Blu Corbel:	a security operations center can be ran from a laptop at home remotely.
02:16:03	Salahdine AFFOUN:	soc is a team and they have to work remotely rather than be located in DC?
02:16:03	Robin van Bergen:	@Cory, a SOC which is not 24x7x365 is a waste of money, but you also need staff to respond to alserts from SOC to have any effect
02:16:08	T B:	@John - Most was necessary (basic PII for authentication purposes), however we then had far more access to financial history and other aspects of a person/organistion's financials than required. A lot was unnecessary.
02:16:27	K Green:	@Jeffrey no but I'm going to look it up, thanks
02:16:56	Levi:	I agree Robin
02:17:50	cory McInnes:	true its expansive but my gov org has a 24hr CSOC
02:18:25	Jason Brown:	I _am_ the SOC at my current company. Hopefully not for long, but for various reasons I’ve lost a bunch of on-call resource recently. A SOC does not have to be an aircraft carrier full of nerds
02:18:31	Troy Paterson:	SOC that cover 24x7x365 (follow the Sun service) are expensive.
Larger orgs will use MSSP
02:18:42	Lily Nguyen:	We'll be closing the Q&A very soon so if you have a question for the mentor, post it in the Q&A section.
02:18:44	Mat Sanchez:	mygov? didn't they get hacked recently or maybe I thinking of someone else
02:18:56	Levi:	Jason, I can imagine you have a nice setup at home to monitor everything :D
02:19:24	Robin van Bergen:	@Jason: 100 inch screens :-)
02:19:40	T B:	🥲
02:19:43	K Green:	since we're compare/contrast to Cisco CCNA and Cisco CyberOps please know they are transitioning NetAcad to SkillsForAll, and that there is maintenance for this Fri/Sat urgently, and scheduled 23 February
02:20:02	Jason Brown:	@Levi yeah, I have a few machines. I can see eight computer screens from my desk. Ironically the one that usually shows the dashboard… is blank
02:20:20	Jason Brown:	I’ll turn it back on in a bit.
02:20:37	Mat Sanchez:	Jason you work for a bank ?
02:20:47	Jason Brown:	Nope, startup in the NDIS space
02:20:49	jeffrey Phuah:	Mean Time to Contain = 15 mins
02:20:50	Tim S:	@ Jason Brown - but a "an aircraft carrier full of nerds" sounds like an awesome place to work 😁
02:21:20	Jared T:	+1 @Tim :P
02:21:27	Robin van Bergen:	not in North East Queensland Australia at the moment, with the cyclone approaching
02:21:42	Benjamin Stokes Stokes:	Awesome - Thanks!
